            I have spent the past few days pouring all my learned skills in
            building this blog page on my mock site. I was a bit skeptical about
            the approach I would use because I was pretty much stuck and
            undecided. I had so many options to choose from and I had become
            boggled down by the sheer enormity of the resources available to me.
            I have spent quite a considerable amount of time (over a year now)
            learning about website creation; though I wasn't as consistent as I
            would've loved to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my readings, it has always occurred to me that I needed to start
            doing and stop consuming tons of information. Often times, I would
            engage in a few self-driven projects, but I could not muster the
            consistency to enable me learn deeply and truly. At certain times,
            it was simply bits and pieces of exercises I had laboured over, that
            I would recollect for my efforts. There was nothing tangible I could
            point to that I had done of which I could be proud. I would berate
            myself over and again because I was cognizant of my lack of effort
            in aspiring to produce/create some quality work that might reflect
            my <em>"growing"</em> knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            The past couple months have made me realize the importance of taking
            the initiative and being responsible for my life. It has tortured me
            into developing a mindset of self-sufficiency and personal growth.
            Getting up and reaching out for my own good is a critical component
            in developing resilience and self-reliance in my life.<q
              class="post-quote"
            >
              No one's coming to save me!</q
            >Being alone has provided me an opportunity to have a glance in the
            mirror; to see what is there; and to summon the will to admit what
            should be.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building this blog post has made me – once again – realize how
            important it is to create. How much of me it has taken – my energy,
            my will, and my desire to produce something better than I always
            have. From setting up the layout; choosing the right fonts; deciding
            on which colours to use; what kind of element would fit in certain
            contexts; and so much more, it has taken me through my existing
            domain of expertise and acquainted me with novel ideas and concepts.
            I now understand what it means <em>to do</em>. Doing opens the eyes
            as it does the mind. It opens up new opportunities to learn and
            grow. It creates an avenue for pragmatism and practicality. It shows
            my weakness(es); it enables me practice intellectual humility.<q
              class="post-quote"
              >Practice makes <del>perfect</del> progress!</q
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence, so it's been for the past two-and-a-half days, putting the
            final touches on what might end up being the final layout for my
            long awaited blog post. It's been a long time coming and I have
            procrastinated for too long. It was a matter of time; I have made it
            possible by bringing the time nearer. Taking the initiative, and
            doing what is right. For my own good!
